The first way, and what I expected the website does to display the winner, is to check `match.mapList[0-6].winnerGroupId`, which gives the ID of the team which won each game of the match. This ID can be checked against `alphaGroupId` or `bravoGroupId` to see which team was the winner. The team that won the most maps is the winner of the match.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there is an easier, second way to find the information we want. Since we don't care about the actual score of the game, just the winner, we can check `groupAlpha.members[0].skillDifference.spDiff`. If this value is positive, then the first team was the winner, and if it's negative then the second team won. This is because this value contains the amount of points gained or lost as a result of the match, and since the team that wins will always gain points, and the team that loses will always lose points, this can be used to determine the result of the match.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are times when the second method will not work. This is when the players do not have ratings before the match started, since there won't be a gain or loss of points when the match ends. However, for this project, we must ignore matches where not all players have a rank, since the ranks of all players is important for our data. Thus, this method should always work for finding the result of the match."

We can find this match using a binary search algorithm. All matches which exist should return a status code of `200`, meaning that it exists. Additionally, all match IDs which don't yet exist should return error code `404`. Since we have a range of values which all appear before the index we want to find, and a different range which appears only after the index, we can use binary search."
